      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25148v1",
      "summary": "Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.\nWe argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference\nLearning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,\nSupervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement\nLearning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due\nto a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the\npolicy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge\nbrittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,\nground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,\nungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data\nsources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization\nproblem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel\nframework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.\nUniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning\nfrom mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense\nexpert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,\ninherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We\nevaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507\nas the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on\nQwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the\nteacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm\nthat UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both\nstronger performance and better behavioral alignment.",

      "summary": "This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building\nrepresentations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature\nField ($\\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events\nfrom past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion\ninformation. $\\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to\nnoise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas\nfrom multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and\n440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous\nspatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream\ntasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,\nsemantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from\nthree robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),\nacross different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments\n(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors\n(resolutions and event rates).

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25144v1",
      "summary": "We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline\nthat synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel\ndata. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,\npractitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,\nor only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom\nboth. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely\non costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses\nthis by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise\nintermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs\nfrom IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,\nyielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five\nbenchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization\n(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired\nsetting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained\nonly on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora\nand other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated\npairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of\ndirect synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only\nPbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,\nhighlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the\nmismatch, limiting direct synthesis.",
