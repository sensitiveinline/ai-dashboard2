Specifically, we\nleverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of\ncreating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,\nPrompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then\nleverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,\nbringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user\nstudy, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers\nthe barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from\nimaginative ideas.",

      "summary": "As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and\nmore complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their\nconversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users\nbetter manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal\nalignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results\nwith examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to\nnavigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20\nparticipants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat\ninterface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and\neffort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to\novercome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can\nenhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired\ndesign implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal\ncommunication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable\nfeedback to improve LLM performance.",
