      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15769v1",
      "summary": "3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest\ndue to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the\nchallenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene\nimage. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a\nnovel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as\ninput, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.\nNotably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;\n(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and\nglobal scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature\nextraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of\n3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;\n(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input\nscenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our\narchitectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image\ninputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the\nefficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this\nparadigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,\npotentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code\nand model will be publicly available at: https://mengmouxu.github.io/SceneGen.",

      "summary": "Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical\nreasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their\ncapacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional\ndecomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate\npolynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science\nand engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and\ninsight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data\ngeneration pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.\nSecond, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them\nacross four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.\nThird, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a\nrank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.\nFinetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to\nhalf, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our\nmodel demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,\noutperforming Mathematica in various cases.",

      "summary": "Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact\nwith the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is\na significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve\nmulti-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In\nthis work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated\nreal-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,\nthat require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file\noperations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a\nnovel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather\nthan raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world\nenvironments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate\nbelow 60\\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed\nablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and\ninefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing\ncurrent models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world\nagent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably\nexecute complex tasks through tool use.",
