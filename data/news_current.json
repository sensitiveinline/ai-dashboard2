Conversely, less\nattention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding\ncapabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment\nbetween visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have\napplied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring\nexpression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either\nreferring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these\nfine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly\ncomprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our\nmodel distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception\nwith general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel\nprocesses visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs\nsubsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during\ninference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The\neffectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a\ndiverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and\nobject-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that\njointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also\ndesigned to verify the flexibility of our method.",

      "summary": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard technique for\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, enabling large\nlibraries of LoRAs, each for a specific task or domain. Efficiently selecting\nthe correct LoRA adapter for a given input remains a challenge, particularly in\nsecure environments where supervised training of routers may raise privacy\nconcerns. Motivated by previous approaches, we formalize the goal of\nunsupervised LoRA routing in terms of activation norm maximization, providing a\ntheoretical framework for analysis. We demonstrate the discriminative power of\nactivation norms and introduce SEQR, an unsupervised LoRA routing algorithm\ndesigned to maximize efficiency while providing strict routing guarantees. SEQR\nprovably identifies the norm-maximizing adapter with significantly greater\nefficiency, making it a highly scalable and effective solution for dynamic LoRA\ncomposition. We validate our results through experiments that demonstrate\nimproved multi-task performance and efficiency.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18091v1",
      "summary": "Despite the growing interest in replicating the scaled success of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in industrial search and recommender systems, most\nexisting industrial efforts remain limited to transplanting Transformer\narchitectures, which bring only incremental improvements over strong Deep\nLearning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). From a first principle perspective, the\nbreakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two\ncomplementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries\nwith contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step\nreasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate\nreasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock\nsubstantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking\nsystems.\n  In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly\nintegrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and\nranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure\nTransformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1)\nstructured context engineering, which augments interaction history with\npreference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized\ninput sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning,\nwhich equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales\nreasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which\nleverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during\ntraining. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario\nof Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business\nmetrics, including over $+2\\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\\%$ increase in advertising\nrevenue.",
