      "summary": "Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,\nbut accurately capturing spatial relationships like \"above\" or \"to the right\nof\" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship\nfollowing with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to\nenhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.\nWe propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position\ncontrol into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via\nautomatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both\nspatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects\nwithin designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We\nfind that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate\nand cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully\ncomplete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for\nposition-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept\nof Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top\nmodels still have significant room for improvement in position-based\ngeneration. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances\nbase models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%\non PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on\nPosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while\nintegrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/ExplainableML/Stitch.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26633v1",
      "summary": "A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to\nretarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning\n(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the\nsignificant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically\nimplausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,\ncommon retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment\ninteractions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To\naddress this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data\ngeneration engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and\npreserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the\nterrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation\nbetween the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,\nOmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,\npreserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from\na single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object\nconfigurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions\nfrom OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour\ntrajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact\npreservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables\nproprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30\nseconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained\nwith only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,\nwithout any learning curriculum.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26632v1",
      "summary": "This paper introduces \\textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics\ndesigned to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level\nrepresentation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single\nvalues, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a\nhierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through\nuser-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the\nscope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency\nand facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,\nagentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We\npresent definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a\nlarge-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python\ncode. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex\nconstructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more\ninterpretable AI evaluation.",
