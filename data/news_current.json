      "summary": "The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI\napplications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,\nwhere diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey\nprovides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\nas a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level\nadaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established\nliterature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward\nMCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions\nto standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy\ncovering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,\nintegration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal\nthree key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of\nisolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables\nsemantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration\nparadigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap\npositioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,\nand intelligent transport infrastructures.",

      "summary": "As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve\ncomplex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps\nhas become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by\nproviding step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major\ndrawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing\nexplanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets\nlimits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward\nmodeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose\na generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,\nmeta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.\nOur model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative\noutcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on\nintermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the\npolicy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.",
