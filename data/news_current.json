Unlike many prior models that\nrelease weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner\nrights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data,\nretroactively respecting robots.txt exclusions and filtering for\nnon-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks\nof memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly\nsuppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task\nperformance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on\n15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to\nnon-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches\nstate-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks,\nrivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we\nrelease all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive\nlicense, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites,\nand training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.",
