      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v1",
      "summary": "The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for\ndata-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its\nvalidity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary\npost-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of\ntrajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data.",

      "summary": "We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary\nfoundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured\ndata. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large\nstructured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint\ndistribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide\nrange of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single\nmodel. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an\nepisodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query\nsubsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,\ntraining-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large\nstructured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature\ndimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,\nmissingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified\ninterface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including\ngradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation\nmodels, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The\nsuperiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,\nregression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial\nmargins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per\ntask. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03503v1",
      "summary": "Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge\ndevices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and\ncommunication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their\nparticipation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge\ndevices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to\nconduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these\ndevices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and\nincreases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method\nused for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to\nzeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order\noptimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to\ncorrect. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,\nZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.\nZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction\ntechniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource\nclients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp\neliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the\nserver and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the\nup-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various\ndatasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm\nthat can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with\na high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from\ntraining, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of\ndata, thus improving training outcomes.",
