      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21319v1",
      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM\npost-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with\ninterpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that\nusually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus\non correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary\nFlexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven\npreferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward\nmodels to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.\nRLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.\naccuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language\nfeedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as\nan entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary\nprinciple). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform\nBradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on\nRM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,\n2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time\nto customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry\nmodels. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to\nalign Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the\nperformance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of\nMT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).",

      "summary": "We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that\nbrings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our\napproach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a\nreformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step\ngeneration. We introduce two key innovations: \"timestep sharing\" to reduce\ngradient noise and \"split-timestep fine-tuning\" to improve prompt alignment.\nCombined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder\nrestructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid\ngeneration and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware\nconfigurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,\nfrom mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including\nlarge-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently\noutperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly\naccessible for practical deployment.",
