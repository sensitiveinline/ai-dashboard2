The influence of various parameter selections and their value\nadjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a\npowerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be\nchallenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some\nhyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter\nvalues without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative\nto understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State\nNetwork architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the\nrequirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as\nwell as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to\nvariations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a\nseries of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including\ntime series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time\nseries classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on\nthe performance of Echo State Network.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10881v1",
      "summary": "Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,\nand colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent\nadvances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading\nto error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches\nstruggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame\nsketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring\nas few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels\nwith sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal\nlocation for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual\nworkload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.\nTo evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring\nhuman-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,\nmotion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more\nflexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.",

      "title": "Searching for Privacy Risks in LLM Agents via Simulation",
      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10880v1",
      "summary": "The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a\ncritical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in\nmulti-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents.",
