      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20096v1",
      "summary": "Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) face significant\nchallenges in specialized domains such as scientific computing, where both\nlong-horizon planning and precise execution are required. Existing approaches\nsuffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly\nin execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness.\nRecent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a\nplanner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which\nprevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the\nscarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework\nthat integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor\n(Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage,\nSpecialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner\nfor each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of\ntask trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all\nsuccessful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated\ndataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner.\nThis equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.\nEvaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark,\nCODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art\namong open-source models.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20095v1",
      "summary": "Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) involves generating collision-free\ntrajectories for multiple robots operating in a shared continuous workspace.\nWhile discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due\nto their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory\nquality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer\nhigher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in\npoor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the\nlimitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that\nintegrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models.\nThe resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key\ncharacteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into\ntractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines\ndiscrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide\ndiffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and\n(3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure\ntrajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art\nperformance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while\nachieving planning efficiency and high success rates.",
