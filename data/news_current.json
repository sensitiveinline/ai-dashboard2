Unlike many prior models that\nrelease weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner\nrights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data,\nretroactively respecting robots.txt exclusions and filtering for\nnon-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks\nof memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly\nsuppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task\nperformance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on\n15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to\nnon-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches\nstate-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks,\nrivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we\nrelease all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive\nlicense, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites,\nand training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14223v1",
      "summary": "We show that language models' activations linearly encode when information\nwas learned during training. Our setup involves creating a model with a known\ntraining order by sequentially fine-tuning Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint but\notherwise similar datasets about named entities. We find that the average\nactivations of test samples for the six training datasets encode the training\norder: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly\nin the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that\nlinear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish \"early\" vs. \"late\" entities,\ngeneralizing to entities unseen during the probes' own training. The model can\nalso be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entity's training stage (~80%\naccuracy). Interestingly, this temporal signal does not seem attributable to\nsimple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence. Our\npaper demonstrates that models are capable of differentiating information by\nits acquisition time, and carries significant implications for how they might\nmanage conflicting data and respond to knowledge modifications.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14216v1",
      "summary": "Stochastic optimization powers the scalability of modern artificial\nintelligence, spanning machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning,\nand large language model training. Yet, existing theory remains largely\nconfined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and\northogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as\nmirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning,\nnatural gradient descent in information geometry, or\nKullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based\nHilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work\nintroduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations,\nestablishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization.\nIt (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer\nmonotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural\ngradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations\n($\\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and\nelucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems\nspanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and\nreal-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks),\ndeep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning\n(actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show\nup to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over\nclassical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a\ncornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms.",
