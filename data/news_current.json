      "summary": "Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational\ncognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are\nremembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and\nprocedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real\nlife the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing\npatterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally\nminimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes\nare treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,\nasking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,\nsituational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not\nvague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,\nmodeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging\nphenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such\nspecificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical\naims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and\nworthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA\nexample of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied\nmore broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.",

This paper introduces a\ncontrastive learning framework for musical instrument retrieval, enabling\ndirect querying of instrument databases using a single model for both single-\nand multi-instrument sounds. We propose techniques to generate realistic\npositive/negative pairs of sounds for virtual musical instruments, such as\nsamplers and synthesizers, addressing limitations in common audio data\naugmentation methods.\n  The first experiment focuses on instrument retrieval from a dataset of 3,884\ninstruments, using single-instrument audio as input. Contrastive approaches are\ncompetitive with previous works based on classification pre-training. The\nsecond experiment considers multi-instrument retrieval with a mixture of\ninstruments as audio input. In this case, the proposed contrastive framework\noutperforms related works, achieving 81.7\\% top-1 and 95.7\\% top-5 accuracies\nfor three-instrument mixtures.",
