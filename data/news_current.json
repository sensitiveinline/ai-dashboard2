Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13143v1",
      "summary": "Autonomous agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated promising capabilities in automating complex tasks. However,\ncurrent evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically\nanalyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within\nthese systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative\nprogrammable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this\nbenchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with\ntwo LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%.\nThrough in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure\ncauses aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution\nissues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose\nactionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis\ncapabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides\nan empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous\nagent systems in the future.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13124v1",
      "summary": "Abstractive summarization is a core application in contact centers, where\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) generate millions of summaries of call transcripts\ndaily. Despite their apparent quality, it remains unclear whether LLMs\nsystematically under- or over-attend to specific aspects of the transcript,\npotentially introducing biases in the generated summary. While prior work has\nexamined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to\ncontact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained\nunexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon\na taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)\nfor the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages\nan LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each\nbias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then\nquantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between\ndistributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using\nBlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and\ntheir summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,\nLlama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present\nacross all evaluated models, regardless of size or family.",
