      "summary": "Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that\ndemand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models\nstill struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from\nthe lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric\nimages. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically\nfail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation\npipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized\nfrom 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from\nmathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key\nfeatures of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization\nand yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution\nscenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of\n$2.8\\%\\text{-}4.8\\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks\nwith non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with\n$2.4\\%\\text{-}3.9\\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks\nin MMMU.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15210v1",
      "summary": "Realistic sound simulation plays a critical role in many applications. A key\nelement in sound simulation is the room impulse response (RIR), which\ncharacterizes how sound propagates from a source to a listener within a given\nspace. Recent studies have applied neural implicit methods to learn RIR using\ncontext information collected from the environment, such as scene images.\nHowever, these approaches do not effectively leverage explicit geometric\ninformation from the environment. To further exploit the potential of neural\nimplicit models with direct geometric features, we present Mesh-infused Neural\nAcoustic Field (MiNAF), which queries a rough room mesh at given locations and\nextracts distance distributions as an explicit representation of local context.\nOur approach demonstrates that incorporating explicit local geometric features\ncan better guide the neural network in generating more accurate RIR\npredictions. Through comparisons with conventional and state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods, we show that MiNAF performs competitively across various\nevaluation metrics. Furthermore, we verify the robustness of MiNAF in datasets\nwith limited training samples, demonstrating an advance in high-fidelity sound\nsimulation.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15207v1",
      "summary": "We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing\ninstead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement\nlearning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods\n(\\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while\nneglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In\ncontrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution\nusing a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL\ndivergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this\nidea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration\nand generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and\ncode reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of\n$10.0\\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs\nconsistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward\ndistribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse\nreasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.",
