      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26644v1",
      "summary": "Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,\nbut accurately capturing spatial relationships like \"above\" or \"to the right\nof\" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship\nfollowing with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to\nenhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.\nWe propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position\ncontrol into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via\nautomatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both\nspatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects\nwithin designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We\nfind that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate\nand cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully\ncomplete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for\nposition-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept\nof Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top\nmodels still have significant room for improvement in position-based\ngeneration. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances\nbase models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%\non PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on\nPosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while\nintegrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/ExplainableML/Stitch.",
