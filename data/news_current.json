      "summary": "Intelligent agents progress by continually refining their capabilities\nthrough actively exploring environments. Yet robot policies often lack\nsufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods\nthat encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are\nunsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their\neffectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a\nframework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic\nmanipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant\nfactors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring\nsafety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with\narbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without\ndegrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space\nenables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher\ntask success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample\nefficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled\napproach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website:\nhttps://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19277v1",
      "summary": "Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder\ncharacterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the\nbody. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and\nlongitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation\nmethods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds\nof lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored\nto this challenge.\n  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation\nmodel that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment\nAnything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was\ntrained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using\nT2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient\nlevel into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three\nreflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength\nvariation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).\n  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of\n0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC:\n0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained\nunder MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC:\n0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1\nscores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader\nvariability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68),\ncomparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).\n  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable\ninteractive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong\ngeneralization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.",
