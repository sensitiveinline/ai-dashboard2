      "summary": "AI-readiness describes the degree to which data may be optimally and\nethically used for subsequent AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) methods, where\nthose methods may involve some combination of model training, data\nclassification, and ethical, explainable prediction. The Bridge2AI consortium\nhas defined the particular criteria a biomedical dataset may possess to render\nit AI-ready: in brief, a dataset's readiness is related to its FAIRness,\nprovenance, degree of characterization, explainability, sustainability, and\ncomputability, in addition to its accompaniment with documentation about\nethical data practices.\n  To ensure AI-readiness and to clarify data structure and relationships within\nBridge2AI's Grand Challenges (GCs), particular types of metadata are necessary.\nThe GCs within the Bridge2AI initiative include four data-generating projects\nfocusing on generating AI/ML-ready datasets to tackle complex biomedical and\nbehavioral research problems. These projects develop standardized, multimodal\ndata, tools, and training resources to support AI integration, while addressing\nethical data practices. Examples include using voice as a biomarker, building\ninterpretable genomic tools, modeling disease trajectories with diverse\nmultimodal data, and mapping cellular and molecular health indicators across\nthe human body.\n  This report assesses the state of metadata creation and standardization in\nthe Bridge2AI GCs, provides guidelines where required, and identifies gaps and\nareas for improvement across the program. New projects, including those outside\nthe Bridge2AI consortium, would benefit from what we have learned about\ncreating metadata as part of efforts to promote AI readiness.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents deployed in real-world environments face\ndegradation from sensor faults, actuator wear, and environmental shifts, yet\nlack intrinsic mechanisms to detect and diagnose these failures. We present an\ninformation-theoretic framework that reveals both the fundamental dynamics of\nRL and provides practical methods for diagnosing deployment-time anomalies.\nThrough analysis of state-action mutual information patterns in a robotic\ncontrol task, we first demonstrate that successful learning exhibits\ncharacteristic information signatures: mutual information between states and\nactions steadily increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite growing\nstate entropy, indicating that agents develop increasingly selective attention\nto task-relevant patterns. Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint\nmutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during\nearly learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a\ntransition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately\nactionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system\nfailures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad\ncollapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action\ncoupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts\naction-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This\ndifferential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation\nexperiments enables precise fault localization without architectural\nmodifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns\nas both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the\nfoundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and\npolicy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles.",
