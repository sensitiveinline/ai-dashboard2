      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07969v1",
      "summary": "Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools\nwith reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing\nopen-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow\nonly a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for\ndifficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking\npaths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.",

      "summary": "We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language\nmodels. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with\npreferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment\nand selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect\nbehavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring\nstates such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across\nsemantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of\nmutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between\nstated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference\nsatisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare\nproxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an\nilluminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the\nconsistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions\nthan others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to\nthis, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the\ncognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently\nuncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of\nlanguage models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of\nwelfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.",
