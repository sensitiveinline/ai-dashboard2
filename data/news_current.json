      "summary": "Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging\npretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent\noutputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare\nconcepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose\nMV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images\nfrom a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion\nmodel on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.\nTraining such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid\nstrategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.\nThis involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views\nthat simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside\ntraining on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out\nview prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other\nviews to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD\nevaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.\nExperiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and\npersonalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D\nconsistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while\nmaintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.",

      "summary": "This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous\nnavigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The\nproposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level\nnavigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task\nperformance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion\ncommands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to\nprevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation\nmethods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating\nerratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world\nvalidations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and\neffectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a\nscalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,\nreal-world scenarios.",

A\ncompetitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs\ncomprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical\nattributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and\ndata is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched\nby indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.\nAlthough considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI\nsystems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and\nthere is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of\nevaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,\nunstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured\nevaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized\nattributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that\nfilters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize\nprecision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our\ncompetitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research\n(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with\nenterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst\nturnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\\sim$3 hours ($\\sim$20x) for the\ncompetitive analysis.",
