      "summary": "The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language\nmodels has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess\nthe quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is\nalso performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI\nmodel. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to\nredundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include\nsusceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,\nmethods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our\nposition paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help\novercome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward\nmodels on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.\nGrounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer\nalignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference\nelicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and\ncalibration-aware meta-evaluation.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03230v1",
      "summary": "GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel\ncoordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for\ncurrent VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which\nbreaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.\nCurrent approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual\nfeatures, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings\nimplicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new\nresolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER\ntokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference\npositions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate\ncoordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial\nencoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,\naddressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on\nScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in\ngrounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution\ninterfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on\nimplicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across\ndiverse resolutions and platforms.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03224v1",
      "summary": "We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:\nimperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a\nmodel. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,\nwhich can lead to information loss, we propose to \"combat noise with noise\" by\nleveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing\ninformation loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to\nthe input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them\nbefore mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a\nclosed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network\narchitectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for\nspecific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,\narchitecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show\nstate-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,\nestablish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including\nstereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and\npracticality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our\nmethod recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%\non stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of\nadversarial attacks.",
