      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21319v1",
      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM\npost-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with\ninterpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that\nusually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus\non correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary\nFlexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven\npreferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward\nmodels to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.\nRLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.\naccuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language\nfeedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as\nan entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary\nprinciple). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform\nBradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on\nRM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,\n2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time\nto customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry\nmodels. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to\nalign Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the\nperformance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of\nMT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).",

Our\napproach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a\nreformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step\ngeneration. We introduce two key innovations: \"timestep sharing\" to reduce\ngradient noise and \"split-timestep fine-tuning\" to improve prompt alignment.\nCombined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder\nrestructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid\ngeneration and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware\nconfigurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,\nfrom mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including\nlarge-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently\noutperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly\naccessible for practical deployment.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21310v1",
      "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional\nbenchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks\nthat probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE\n(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed\nto assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:\nHuman Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,\nClustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks\nthat focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding\nthrough adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human\njudgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding\nmodels and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no\nsingle approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while\nstate-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate\nin aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical\nmetric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on\ninformation sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of\n0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers\ncritical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest\nclustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the\nlowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current\nsemantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of\nmodel robustness for real-world deployment.",
