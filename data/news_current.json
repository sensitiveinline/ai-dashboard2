      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v1",
      "summary": "Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet\ngenerating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge.\nThis process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and\nimplementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and\nverbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software\nstructures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG),\na persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level\nplanning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions\nin one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit\nblueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation.\nBuilding on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository\ngeneration from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning\nand implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by\ngraph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we\nconstruct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks.\nOn RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly\n3.9$\\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\\times$ other\nbaselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate,\nexceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further\nanalysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more\nsophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM\nunderstanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.",
