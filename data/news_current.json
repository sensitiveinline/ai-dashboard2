      "summary": "Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation\nwith clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.\nWe systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public\nmammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,\nabnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently\nwas the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and\ndomain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores\namong GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),\ncalcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it\nattained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%\nmalignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection\nand 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS\naccuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared\nwith human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and\nspecificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening\ntasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging\napplications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the\ntremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising\ntrend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with\nmammography VQA tasks.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11616v1",
      "summary": "As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it\nis becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In\nthis paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To\nachieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs\nand demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method\ninvolves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide\nthe MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to\nindependently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's\noutput. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference\nprocess in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of\neach reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off\nobject precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving\ncontrol over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to\ncontrol the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of\nvisual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination\nbenchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM\ninference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation\nmethods.",
