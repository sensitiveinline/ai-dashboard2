Despite recent advancements, these models\nstill struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from\nthe lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric\nimages. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically\nfail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation\npipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized\nfrom 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from\nmathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key\nfeatures of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization\nand yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution\nscenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of\n$2.8\\%\\text{-}4.8\\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks\nwith non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with\n$2.4\\%\\text{-}3.9\\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks\nin MMMU.",
