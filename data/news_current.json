      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09987v1",
      "summary": "Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong\nperformance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.\nSeveral studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance\nopen-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance\nacross standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other\nfoundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains\nacross multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.",

      "summary": "Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is\ncritical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental\nmonitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are\nunreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which\nthe reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique\nriver segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov\nDecision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which\nrefines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline\ncomputed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage\nestimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in\nnon-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on\npatchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and\ndata-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent\nvision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics\nEstimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM\nfor cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of\nsolving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.\nSimulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and\nsuperior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized\nAdvantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions\nthat enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,\nCADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the\nLagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during\ntraining, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard\naction overlay.",
