      "summary": "We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series\nforecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node\nis a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance\nmetrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed\nedges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting\nfuture values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph\nprovides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling\nevaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness\nduring operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial\ncontrol systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely\ncombines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable\ndependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We\nreport baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series\nfoundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a\nrealistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware\nevaluation in microservice systems.",

      "summary": "The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled\nthe community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to\nspecific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models\nremains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.\nWe introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as\nvector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to\na base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and\ntask, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also\ndemonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and\nexhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,\nwe show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and\nfurther explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta\nActivations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.\nCode is available at https://github.com/OscarXZQ/delta_activations.",

      "summary": "We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that\nsensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability\nof the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand\nexoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision\n+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural\nenvironments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,\nproviding users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors\nthe human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of\ndemonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make\ntask demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,\nincreasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of\ndexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect\nhigh-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data\nsignificantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection\ncompared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot\ndexterity.
