      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20354v1",
      "summary": "We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model\nbased on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe\nstrategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder\ninitialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model\nrobustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure\ngeneralizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures.\nEvaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual,\nEnglish, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art\nresults. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,\nwith fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models\ndouble its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,\nthis lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding\noutputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and\nhigh-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation\nstudies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the\ncommunity to promote further research.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20341v1",
      "summary": "Ge'ez is an ancient Semitic language renowned for its unique alphabet. It\nserves as the script for numerous languages, including Tigrinya and Amharic,\nand played a pivotal role in Ethiopia's cultural and religious development\nduring the Aksumite kingdom era. Ge'ez remains significant as a liturgical\nlanguage in Ethiopia and Eritrea, with much of the national identity\ndocumentation recorded in Ge'ez. These written materials are invaluable primary\nsources for studying Ethiopian and Eritrean philosophy, creativity, knowledge,\nand civilization. Ge'ez has a complex morphological structure with rich\ninflectional and derivational morphology, and no usable NLP has been developed\nand published until now due to the scarcity of annotated linguistic data,\ncorpora, labeled datasets, and lexicons. Therefore, we propose a rule-based\nGe'ez morphological synthesizer to generate surface words from root words\naccording to the morphological structures of the language. We used 1,102 sample\nverbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the\nsystem. The system achieves a performance of 97.4%, outperforming the baseline\nmodel and suggesting that future work should build a comprehensive system\nconsidering morphological variations of the language.\n  Keywords: Ge'ez, NLP, morphology, morphological synthesizer, rule-based",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20338v1",
      "summary": "Conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods rely on\ntime-triggered execution, where agents sample and communicate actions at fixed\nintervals. This approach is often computationally expensive and\ncommunication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG\n(Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a\nframework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its\nevent-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms,\nET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to\nlearn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios\nwith inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based\nvariant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective\ncommunication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to\ntrigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to\nexchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with\nany policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both\ncomputational load and communication overhead.",
