      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09679v1",
      "summary": "Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting\ndeployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these\nmethods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case\ncoherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight\ndistributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces\nHadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by\ncontinuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$\nentries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,\nbutterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization\nwhile guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit\nquantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09677v1",
      "summary": "Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing\nreturns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09674v1",
      "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful\nparadigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by\nlarge-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two\nfundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale\nhuman-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited\ngeneralization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can\ndramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural\nquestion: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action\nplanning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL\nframework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce\nVLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment\nrendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,\nSimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\\pi_0$\non RoboTwin 1.0\\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.\nSimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust\ngeneralization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.\nMoreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,\nwherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in\nthe previous training process.
