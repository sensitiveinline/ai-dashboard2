      "summary": "We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that\nenables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL\nfeatures the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct\nGUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and\nhuman-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial\nfor improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains\nchallenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended\ntraining. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL\ninfrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop\nenvironments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose\nEntropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with\nsupervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended\ntraining runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and\nQwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B\nbased on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,\ndemonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop\nautomation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et\nal., 2024a)",

By carefully designing our training data to match\nthe characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively\nenhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,\nfrom single-view to sparse multi-view inputs.

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14031v1",
      "summary": "Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into\nagentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to\nsolve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING\nsignificantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing\ntheir effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting\napproaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation\ntasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that\nprefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance\ngains.
