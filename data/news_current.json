      "summary": "Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily\non daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable\nin real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual\nquestion answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the\nintroduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation\nquality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between\nlighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct\nEgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and\nrefinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked\nby annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs\nacross 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of\nhuman work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the\ndata and code will be made available upon acceptance.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06217v1",
      "summary": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework\nfor enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),\nparticularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their\npotential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains\nunderexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing\nPRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle\nwith table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema\ninteraction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)\nreasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based\nverification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design\na scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality\nstep-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with\ntool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a\ndual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use\nreasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded\nreward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly\ndesigned PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering\nnumerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves\ndownstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines\nsuch as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong\ngeneralizability across diverse TTS strategies.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06214v1",
      "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as\nsearch engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies. These results establish stratification as a\nprincipled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.",
