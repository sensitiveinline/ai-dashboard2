      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09987v1",
      "summary": "Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong\nperformance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.\nSeveral studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance\nopen-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance\nacross standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other\nfoundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains\nacross multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.",
