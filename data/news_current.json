      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14896v1",
      "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a\npromising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language\ngeneration tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding\nstrategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains\nchallenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.\nWhile post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted\ntechnique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing\ndiffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of\nactivation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that\ndominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit\nquantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority\nof values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model\nvariants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,\nquantization method, task category, and model type. Through this\nmulti-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization\nbehavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide\na foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and\nexperimental setups will be released to support the community.",

      "summary": "Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges\nevolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive\nrepresentation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:\neffectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph\ninformation. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph\nStructure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We\ndesign a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize\nnode neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through\ntheoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by\nextending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing\nboth edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function\nvia variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.\nGTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;\nthey outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,\nwith significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.",

      "summary": "We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing\nmachines, showing ${\\rm TIME}[[t] \\subseteq {\\rm SPACE}[O(\\sqrt{t})]$. The key\nstep is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes\nthe canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run\ninto a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\\log\nT)$ for $T = \\lceil t/b \\rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ work at leaves, $O(1)$\nat internal nodes, and edges that are logspace-checkable; semantic correctness\nacross merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ window replay at the unique\ninterface. The proof uses midpoint (balanced) recursion, a per-path potential\nthat bounds simultaneously active interfaces by $O(\\log T)$, and an\nindegree-capping replacement of multiway merges by balanced binary combiners.\nAlgorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a\nconstant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming,\nensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding\nthe additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b + \\log(t/b))$ for block sizes $b \\ge b_0$ with\n$b_0 = \\Theta(\\log t)$, which at the canonical choice $b = \\Theta(\\sqrt{t})$\ngives $O(\\sqrt{t})$ space; the $b_0$ threshold rules out degenerate blocks\nwhere addressing scratch would dominate the window footprint. The construction\nis uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences\ninclude branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$\nbounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for\nSPACE$[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and\n$O(\\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality\nassumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models.",
