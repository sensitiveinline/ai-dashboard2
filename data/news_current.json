      "summary": "We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online\nprediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous\nmethods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time\nperformance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism\nthat ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,\nthereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large\ncomputation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and\nmaintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera\npose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to\nachieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,\ncamera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive\nexperiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/LiZizun/WinT3R.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during\npretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not\nwell understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as\ntraditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models\nacquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand\nmodel training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and\nalign features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the\nevolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders\nbetween open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and\nrepresentation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects\n(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally\nimportant for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature\nemergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is\narchitecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more\ninterpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout\npretraining.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05276v1",
      "summary": "Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency\nbottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,\nand inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building\nlarge models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and\nefficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of\nbrain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and\ninference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three\naspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention\narchitectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an\nefficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding\nframework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator\nlibraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.\n  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,\nand SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the\nfeasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.\nSpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer\nbaselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our\nmodels significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver\ninference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.\nFor example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token\nfor 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX\nC550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4\npercent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling\nlow-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of\nbrain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and\nscalable large model design.",
