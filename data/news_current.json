      "summary": "Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency\nof compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of\nlossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the\nMulti-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of\nartificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the\nTransformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module\ntermed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses\nout-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To\nvalidate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like\narchitectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive\nexperiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate\nthat AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and\nachieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while\nsubstantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,\naugmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%\nand memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k\nsequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07315v1",
      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage\nLLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language\ninteractions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world\nhuman preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right,\nread cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code\nevaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness,\noverlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this\npaper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece\nunderlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides\nfunctional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following\ncapabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30\nverifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic\nverifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,\nresulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following\nand functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even\nthe strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit\nclear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional\ncorrectness and instruction following correlates the best with human\npreference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on\nreal-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe\ncheck, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that\nbetter align with user preferences in coding.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07314v1",
      "summary": "Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable\nenergy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding\nplasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital\nfor next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the\nnonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over\ntime. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often\nemployed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However,\nthey omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we\nintroduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D\nnonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena\nneglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent\nheat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D,\n(ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent\n3D$\\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and\nthe distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation\ninspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely\nused reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy\ncascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three\norders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows\npromising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for\nscalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.",
