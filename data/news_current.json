      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22651v1",
      "summary": "The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have\nspurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are\ninadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We\nintroduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI\nassistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval\ncomprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks\ninclude natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn\ndialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly\nheterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21\nopen-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response\ncontent and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key\nfindings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source\nmodels; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;\nand (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the\nmid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening\naccuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal\n(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for\ncurrent models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety\nalignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous\nframework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI\nassistants. Code and data will be released at\nhttps://mathllm.github.io/VoiceAssistantEval/ .",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22653v1",
      "summary": "We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language\nnavigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is\ncapable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions\nin any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that\ntreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to\nconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF\nharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative\nannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted\ntraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement\nvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the\ntraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF\nperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow\ndynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong\nbaselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to\nhighlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable\ngeneralization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev",
