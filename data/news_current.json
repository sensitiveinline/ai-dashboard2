      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02307v1",
      "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often\nfail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions\nthan those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are\ncurrently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative\nto their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key\ntechnical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this\nlimitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across\nresolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal\nfrom lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a\ntrain-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that\nrecalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.\nNoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and\nis compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable\nDiffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly\nimproved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and\nFlux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by\n10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent\nartifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.",

      "summary": "Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating\nremarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the\nmechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially\nunderstood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes\nthis success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure\nwithin the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on\nhow such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem\nthrough score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by\ninvestigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score\nmatching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that\nsmoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density\ndomain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we\nshow that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be\ncontrolled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.",

      "summary": "We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework\nbuilt from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the\nnon-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and\nflow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an\nimplicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an\noptimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are\nobtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step\nsizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation\nperformance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on\nImageNet 256$\\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and\nsample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework\nthat naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD\ndetection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with\na unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and\nenergy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.",
