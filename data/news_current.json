      "summary": "We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that\nenables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL\nfeatures the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct\nGUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and\nhuman-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial\nfor improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains\nchallenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended\ntraining. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL\ninfrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop\nenvironments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose\nEntropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with\nsupervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended\ntraining runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and\nQwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B\nbased on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,\ndemonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop\nautomation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et\nal., 2024a)",

We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically\ndesigned to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the\ncoarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent\nspace, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.\nWe introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial\ncorrespondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while\npreserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match\nthe characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively\nenhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,\nfrom single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while\nmaintaining efficiency in training.",
