      "summary": "In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for\nreasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success\nin advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing\ncomplex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has\nemerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the\nrapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces\nfoundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in\nalgorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely\nto revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore\nstrategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence\n(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for\nreasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including\nfoundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream\napplications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly\nevolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for\nbroader reasoning models. Github:\nhttps://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08825v1",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research\nby enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and\ntext analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,\ncommon regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in\nreducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\n  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is\nunacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,\nanything can be presented as statistically significant.",
