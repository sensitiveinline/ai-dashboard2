      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12196v1",
      "summary": "Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token\nrepresentations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each\nlayer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially\ndiverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in\ndomains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static\nrelational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous\ninter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where\ndifferent channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by\nentirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the\nattention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with\ndynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where\neach token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise\ninteractions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per\ninteraction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique\nrelational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction\nfor that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime\nattention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in\nMTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard\nattention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently\noutperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\\%\nimprovement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention\nachieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\\% less sequence\nlength compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior\nrelational modeling capabilities.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12194v1",
      "summary": "BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine\nClinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert\nphysicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI\nevaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted\nreasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.\n  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),\nwe conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create\nCPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and\nmultimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models\n(LLMs). Then, we developed \"Dr. CaBot,\" an AI discussant designed to produce\nwritten and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,\nmodeling the role of the human expert in these cases.\n  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the\nfinal diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,\noutperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached\n98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per\nunit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image\ntasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image\nchallenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,\nphysicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of\ntrials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote\nresearch, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.\n  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based\ndifferential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,\nbut image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and\nCaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.",
