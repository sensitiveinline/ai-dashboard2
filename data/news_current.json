      "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success across various\nscientific fields, yet their adoption in critical decision-making is often\nhindered by a lack of interpretability. Recently, intrinsically interpretable\nGNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by\nidentifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face\nchallenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In\nthis work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a\nnovel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify\npersistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning\napproach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs,\nand introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological\ndiscrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale\nsubgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that\nour loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific\nconditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in\ntackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs,\nbalancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious\ncorrelations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art\nmethods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.",

      "summary": "Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research\ncommunication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often\nrequiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10\nminutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves\ndistinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal\ninformation (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple\naligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101\nresearch papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and\nspeaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta\nSimilarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos\nconvey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we\npropose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation\nvideo generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout\nrefinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,\nsubtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing\nslide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate\nthat the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and\ninformative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward\nautomated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and\ncode are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05095v1",
      "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) generate intermediate reasoning traces before\nproducing final answers, yielding strong gains on multi-step and mathematical\ntasks. Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for\nmodel deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective\nfor preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this\ncomputation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single\nsampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from\nstochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference\noptimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and\npropose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple,\ndrop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based\nestimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling\nreasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces\ntrace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form\nchoice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the\ntrue marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions,\ntightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent.\nEmpirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points\non AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on\ngeneral conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base\nmodels by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks.\nThese results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and\ndemonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more\nstable training and stronger overall performance.",
