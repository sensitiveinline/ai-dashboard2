      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08572v1",
      "summary": "Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress\nof computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in\nrobotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop\nmore generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,\nrobotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic\ntasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically\nsuffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this\nproblem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies\nfrom automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot\ncapabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for\ndiverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to\nfinetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human\nsupervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's\nstate, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based\nmanipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly\nimprove zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.\nMoreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables\ndownscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on\nthe project page.",

      "summary": "Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central\ngoal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on\nfine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.\nWe present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task\ndescription into an actionable plan for a target robot without any\ndemonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a\nvideo generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using\noff-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative\nposes for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals\nand trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a\ntracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics\nmodel. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow\nnaturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and\ndeformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot\nquadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without\ndemonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

Models can match memorized content rather\nthan demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts\ncross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,\na model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test\ncases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse\npool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each\ntest case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original\nobjective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and\naggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose\nshared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations\nthat steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply\nArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains\nand show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new\nfailure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,\nand improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to\ncontinuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation\nmodels.",
