      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06956v1",
      "summary": "Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D\nhuman pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering\nframework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient\ntransformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the\nredundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal\ninformation based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output\nto the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method\nis general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on\nboth seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different\ntoken pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that\nmaintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of\nrepresentative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are\navailable at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.",

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06953v1",
      "summary": "Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable\nenvironments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical\nmotion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full\nenvironment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural\nmotion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop\ndirectly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or\ndynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural\nmotion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic\nenvironments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is\nIMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million\ngenerated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further\nimprove IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher\nfinetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at\ninference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We\nevaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving\nobstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,\noutperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both\nsimulated and real-world settings.

      "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06945v1",
      "summary": "Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve\nsignificant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains\nin instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that\ntightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be\nreleased in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .",
